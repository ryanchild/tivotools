# tivotools

See config_example.yaml for an exmaple config file, you'll need to provide
your TiVo's address and media access key (MAK)

API keys for thetvdb and themoviedb are required to be able to lookup
meaningful show metadata such as season #, episode #, movie year etc.  If/when
this project gets off the ground and will be useful to others, or I figure out
how to hide the API keys such that they won't be easily found by someone
looking for API keys to abuse with a simple google search, I will include them
in a release so that tivotools works out of the box.
